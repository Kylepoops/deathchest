# Development branch
## FAQ
### What is this?
This is where you will find all of the new things im working on for future versions of the plugin. It is **VERY** likely that things dont work as expected, and could contain bugs. *Use at your own risk*
### Why upload code that could crash my server?
I dont recomend you use this if you dont know at least the basics of Java and the Spigot API, but there are some people that do. Those people are free to use this however they want.
### Can you upload jar files?
No. But [this exists](https://bit.ly/IdDL68)
